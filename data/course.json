If that's your goal it's vital that you learn the TypeScript programming language, and that's exactly what we're going to walk through in this course. My name is Jordan Hudgens, and I'll be your instructor for the course. In addition to being the lead instructor for devCamp I've also been building web applications for over a decade for organizations such as Eventbrite and Quip. My focus for this course isn't to teach you how to build TypeScript console applications. Instead, my goal is to teach you the skills you will need in order to build real world Angular 2 applications. And actually, this course includes the exact material we teach at our devCamp coding bootcamps prior to students going through our immersive Angular 2 course. There are no technical pre-requisites to this course. The ideal student is an individual who wants to learn how to build Angular 2 applications. I will show you how to install and run TypeScript programs on both a Mac and a PC. And you can use either operating system to follow along with the course material.",
